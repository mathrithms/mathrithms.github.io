I really liked this new thing and enjoyed finding out squares of some huge number and trying to figure out square roots of random numbers. While doing so my teacher taught me tricks to find square of some special types of numbers such as numbers ending in digit 5, numbers made of strings of 1 and lot more. That inspired me to find some more such tricks. From that day onwards I was too observant for patterns. Soon one day we were taught composite numbers and prime numbers. Well composite numbers had some pattern in it, but primes were random. That stunned me. I tried a lot for finding pattern in them. Hours and hours, I used to think about them. When I asked and read about it through various teachers and sources, I found that there was no pattern found till date. I was surprised that such simple and elegant number dose not have any pattern. As I was growing up, I read lots of articles and notes on prime numbers. This article will sum up all my readings and knowledge about prime numbers.</div>

Similarly, 3 has again two divisors 1 and 3 itself so is prime. 5,7,11,13,17,19,23…….. are all primes. Then there arises a natural question, are prime numbers finite or infinite? This question was answered by Euclid and gave a proof that “there are infinitely many primes.” After Euclid many more mathematicians proved the same in their own way. With the name of Euclid’s proof there comes without saying the most fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that “Every integer greater that 1 can factorized uniquely in prime numbers.” That is, you can factorize any number greater than 1 say for example 6, 6 can be factorized into 2 and 3 prime numbers and there is no any other prime numbers other than 2 and 3 whose product will be 6. With these two famous results one can almost understand every problem in number theory that revolves around primes. There are lots and lots of unsolved problems in number theory and the problems that revolves around prime numbers has a major share.</div><div><br></div><div>

There is unanswered question about its infinitudes. The largest known palindromic prime found has 474,501 digits and the search is still going on. </p><p><strong>Twin Primes</strong>, “Prime numbers that differ by two are knows as twin primes.” 3 and 5 are twin primes (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43),…. are some pairs of twin primes. On this twin prime there is a famous conjecture known as twin prime conjecture which states that “there are infinitely many pairs of twin prime.” Recently there was a progress toward this conjecture by Yitang Zhang, professor at University of New Hampshire. He proved a weaker conjecture of twin primes. </p><p><strong>Mersenne Prime</strong>, “Prime numbers which are one less than the power of two that is primes of the form (2n-1) where n is a positive integer” for example 3 is a Mersenne prime because 3 can be written as (22-1) similarly 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, 524287, 2147483647 are Mersenne primes. Mersenne primes are very useful in number theory and all over mathematics it is used to solve many problems in mathematics and computer science. Likewise, there are lots of special types of prime numbers I will link them at the bottom. There are lots of unsolved problems involving prime numbers to name a few<strong> Goldbach’s conjecture</strong> is one of the oldest one. It states that <strong>“Every integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes”</strong>. For example 3, 3 can be written as 3=2+1 <strong>(Goldbach considered 1 to be a prime)</strong>, similarly 4=2+2 and so on. There are lots of modified versions of Goldbach’s conjecture available. Lots of computer programs are continuously running and verifying these conjectures (NOT PROVING!).

Well the obvious way is to see if it is factorizable into more than two factors except one and the number itself. If it is factorizable then the number is not prime. If it is not, then its prime. But this quite tiresome, one need to find out an easy way to do it. First to do so was an ancient Greek scholar<strong> Eratosthenes of Cyrene</strong>, he developed a sieve for prime numbers. His method was to write down the numbers say from 1 to 100 and strike out the numbers that are divisible by 2 till 100 after that see the next number greater than two which is not struck out, that number will be 3, again strike out the multiples of 3 till 100. Again, check the next unstruck number again strike out its multiples. When the process ends you will be left with primes (unstruck numbers.) His method too was not so efficient for larger numbers. One more simple method to test prime is to take any number say ‘n’ (you want to check) take its square root, then try to divide ‘n’ by the numbers from 2 to ‘√n’ if no number is divisible by ‘n’ then ‘n’ is a prime number. Again, this too have drawbacks it can’t be used for larger number. Many algorithms are designed for primality testing using some famous results from number theory. I will link the primality testing algorithms at the bottom. Nowadays computers are used for primality testing of large numbers.</p><p>At the end of 18th century two great mathematicians <strong>Gauss </strong>and <strong>Legendre </strong>discovered some interesting observation about the distributions of prime. Which is “<em><strong>as the number gets larger and larger the probability of finding prime numbers get lesser and lesser</strong>.</em>” Which is an interesting observations and was mathematically known as The Prime Number Theorem. <strong>Chebyshev </strong>a Russian mathematician came close to prove this, but it was <strong>Hadamard </strong>and <strong>de la Vallée Poussin</strong> who proved this theorem. Later on, various mathematicians proved this theorem in their own way. The easiest of all proof was given by <strong>Donald J. Newman</strong>. Prime numbers are used in cryptography, the difficultness of larger numbers to factorize into prime numbers makes it one of the safest lock to valuable crypt.</p><p>There is lot more to speak on prime numbers. An article of a page or book is not enough to describe its intricate beauty. Prime numbers are lucrative and attracts many enthusiasts to study them. Prime numbers have its own different suave realm. I think one need to see prime numbers from a different perspective and understand its elegance.</p></div>
